\justifying
\begin{itemize}
    \item Malicious party can change certain aspects of training data (\textit{e.g.} features, class labels) to change model weights and bias.
    \item Can also inject poisoned instances that are labeled as the target class to the training data.
    \item NN model learns these false features (\textit{i.e.} trigger) for the target class.
    \item When an input perturbed with such a trigger is passed to the model, it misclassifies, but continues to classify correctly for clean input.
    \item The triggers appear to be natural to human evaluation.% \cite{sun2020natural}.
    \item Any outsourced model is at risk of having backdoor triggers.% \cite{azizi2020defending}.
