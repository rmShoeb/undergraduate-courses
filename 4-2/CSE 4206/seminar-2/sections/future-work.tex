\begin{itemize}
    % \item \citeauthor*{gao2019strip} proposed a Trojan detection method for image classifiers.
    % \item Requires less computation, but needs access to training data.
    \item Combine the methods of \citeauthor*{azizi2021tminer} and \citeauthor*{gao2019strip} for fewer computation without access to training data.
    \item Analyze Defense model's performance against Trojan attacks.
    \item Compare backdoor detection ability with existing methods.
\end{itemize}
