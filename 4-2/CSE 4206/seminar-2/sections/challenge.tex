\justifying

\begin{itemize}
    \item Natural triggers go undetected in human evaluation and grammar checker.
    \item Triggers can be of various types \textit{e.g.} character level, word level, or sentence level.
    \item User has no knowledge of the trigger phrases and the target label/s chosen by the attacker for misclassification.
    \item Finding exact triggers is computationally expensive without knowing the type of attack.
    \item Training data may not be available to the user for finding triggers.
    \item Trojaned models have almost same performance as of a benign model; so presence of Trojan goes unnoticed to user.
\end{itemize}
