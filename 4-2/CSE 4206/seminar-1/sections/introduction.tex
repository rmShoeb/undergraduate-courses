\justifying
\begin{itemize}
    \item Programs have special characteristics, (\textit{e.g.} context-free syntactic structure, type constraints, the programâ€™s semantics, etc), unlike plain text.
    \item As a result, source codes do not have the form suitable to most learning techniques.
    % \item Both syntactic and semantic knowledge contributes more in modeling source code and can obtain better representation than traditional token-based methods \cite{zhang2019novel}.
    \item So, it is necessary to transform the program to a suitable representation before a learning technique can be applied.
