\begin{frame}{Conclusion and Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Existing methods either fails to capture code semantics,
    \item Or, Computation complexity is very high.
    \item Methods with lower complexity has not proved to efficient yet.
    \item CFGs can capture code semantics better.
    \item Graph node embedding promises better vectors.
    \item GNN/GCN can perform selection of high information nodes better.
\end{itemize}
