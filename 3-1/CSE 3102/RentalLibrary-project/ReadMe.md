* run the 'student_rental_library.sql' first to create all the database components for the project.
* this project includes bootstrap, javascript and jquery CDNs. so, to run the project properly, an active internet connection is required.
* this project uses PHP for backend purpose. so, apache server is required to be running.
* carefully setup the environment. even a tiny bit of mistake will not led to produce the desired output.
