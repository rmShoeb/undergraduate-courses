this is a quiz project, a very simple one. it does not have any security (except for user sign in, which is the most vulnarable as it can be) but i want to pass this course.

what this does-
* 

the project uses-
* php
* mysql
* bootstrap cdn
* javascript cdn
* jquery cdn

what you have to do to run this project on your pc-
* apache server need to be running as the project uses php.
* mysql server to be running. you can minimize your problem by installing xampp
* keep the project folder in the htdocs folder in C:/xampp
* create a database named 'quiz'
* import the sql file into the 'quiz' database.
* donot dare to change a damn thing of the project
* the project uses bootstrap, javascript and jquery CDNs, so a working internet connect is required for them.
* and you are good to go.
