# Software Development Project I

This project (was supposed to) does this-
* a student can order for an instrument from the CCR to be kept ready to be collected at a specific time.
* and when it is to be returned.
* the officer can add a new instrument
* approve borrow requests
* or deny them, depending on
	* the avaliability of the desired instrument at the desired time

**forgot to backup the database**
